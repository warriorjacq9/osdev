# Building
To build the cross-comipling tools, follow this tutorial
for the i686-elf target:
https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler

(Note: This takes a while! **Do this first** 
and be prepared to wait).

In the project root folder, run `make build`.

To test the operating system, run `make test`.

# Installation
This project currently runs off of a USB stick. To
 burn to the stick, first run `lsblk` to find your
 stick's device name (mine was `/dev/sdb`). Then,
 run `dd if=myos.iso of=/dev/sdb`. Substitute your
 device name for `/dev/sdb`. Then, eject and remove
 your USB drive, plug it into a computer, and press
 your computer's boot menu button (refer to
 [this table](https://www.disk-image.com/faq-bootmenu.htm)
 to find it) and select "Removable drive" or "USB".
 Enjoy the operating system!
